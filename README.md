## Set up a DevOps CI/CD pipeline to automate the execution of test cases for the application. The pipeline should:
Integrate with a version control system with Azure Repos.
Trigger automatically on code commits or pull requests.
Install required dependencies (Node.js, Jest, Mocha, etc.).
Execute unit, integration, and functional test cases.
Generate and store test reports.
Send notifications for test failures.
